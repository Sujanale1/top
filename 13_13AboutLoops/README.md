# Exercise 13 - AboutLoops

Description of the exercise goes here.
# Loops in JavaScript are a fundamental concept used for repeating a block of code multiple times. Understanding how to use loops effectively can greatly enhance your ability to write efficient and readable code. Here’s a detailed explanation of the different types of loops available in JavaScript and their usage:

1. for Loop
The for loop is one of the most common loops used in JavaScript. It is generally used when the number of iterations is known beforehand.

2. while Loop
The while loop is used when the number of iterations is not known and depends on a condition being true.

3. do...while Loop
The do...while loop is similar to the while loop, but the condition is evaluated after the loop’s code block has executed. This guarantees that the code block executes at least once.

4. for...in Loop
The for...in loop is used for iterating over the enumerable properties of an object.

5. for...of Loop
The for...of loop is used to iterate over iterable objects like arrays, strings, or other collections. It’s introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6).

6. Loop Control Statements
JavaScript provides several control statements to manage the flow of loops:
